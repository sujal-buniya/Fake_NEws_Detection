 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect **fake news articles** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a variety of machine learning models. It explores multiple algorithms to classify news content as either *Real* or *Fake* based on the article text.

 Features

- Preprocessing of news data (cleaning, stopwords removal, etc.)
- Text vectorization using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer
- Multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Passive Aggressive Classifier
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Performance evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for better understanding of the dataset

 Algorithms Used

- **Logistic Regression** – a baseline model for binary classification
- **Passive Aggressive Classifier** – efficient for large datasets
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** – particularly effective for text data
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – good at finding decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces
